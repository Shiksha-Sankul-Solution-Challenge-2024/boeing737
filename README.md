## Overview

The Learning Enhancement System is designed to identify slow and fast learners and implement effective methods to upgrade the learning curve.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

- **Identify Learners:** Analyze learner data to distinguish between slow and fast learners.
- **Implement Capacitive Methods:** Develop strategies to enhance the learning process for slow learners.

## Features

### Identification of Slow and Fast Learners

- **Data Analysis:** Utilize learner data to categorize individuals as slow or fast learners based on predefined criteria.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implement ML models to predict future assessment scores and thus helping in categorizing slow and fast learner and giving him/her a individualized learning plan (ILP).

### Learning Enhancement Strategies

- **Personalized Learning Paths:** Create tailored learning paths or (ILP) individualized learning plan for slow learners to match their pace and comprehension.
- **Adaptive Assessments:** Offer adaptive assessments to adjust difficulty levels based on learner performance.
